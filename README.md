BitMessageWebApp
================

A WebApp for a BitMessageDaemon running on a Server.



Hello, I'm developing with tullyvey a WebApp for a BitMessageDaemon. This
project is in early developement, but some features are already working ;)
My BitMessageDaemon runs on a RaspberryPI Model B and does all of the
en/decrypting and Proof of Work. For security reasons I recommend to access the
WebApp only locally behind a firewall or via an VPN-Tunnel.

I created a chan in BitMessage, where you can get special information about the
project's status and issues.

Chan-Name: bmc
Chan-Address: BM-2cUoRzUeWh7sDz4iAozUUmB8nJq2Q4VRaN
