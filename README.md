BitMessageWebApp
================

A WebApp for a BitMessageDaemon running on a Server.



Hello, I'm developing with tullyvey a WebApp for a BitMessageDaemon. This project is in early developement, but some features are 
already working ;)
My BitMessageDaemon runs on a RaspberryPI Model B and does all of the en/decrypting and Proof of Work. For security reasons I 
recommend to access the WebApp only locally behind a firewall or via an VPN-Tunnel.

I created a chan in BitMessage, where you can get special information about the status and issues.

Chan-Name: bmc
Chan-Address: BM-2cUoRzUeWh7sDz4iAozUUmB8nJq2Q4VRaN


Changelog:
v0.01:
	+First Version, no features only testing.
