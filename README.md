#BitMessageWebApp
================

A WebApp for a BitMessageDaemon running on a Server.


Hello, I'm developing with tullyvey a WebApp for a BitMessageDaemon. This
project is in early developement, but some features are already working ;)
My BitMessageDaemon runs on a RaspberryPI Model B and does all of the
en/decrypting and Proof of Work. For security reasons I recommend to access the
WebApp only locally behind a firewall or via an VPN-Tunnel.

I created a chan in BitMessage, where you can get special information about the
project's status and issues.

Chan-Name: bmc
Chan-Address: BM-2cUoRzUeWh7sDz4iAozUUmB8nJq2Q4VRaN

If you want to add some Code take a look at the development branch.


Working features:
#German Translation (English native)
#Inbox with Pagination
#Delete Message directly from Inbox
#Sending Messages to user and chans
#Adding User and Chan Addresses to Addressbook
#Modify and remove addressbook user-entries, chan-entries still have a bug.
#Status of Message in Outbox and Reading them
#Reply and Redirect Messages
